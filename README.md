# nwsplit
##### Cross platform speedrunning splitter/timer made for [nw.js](http://github.com/nwjs/nw.js) that also works in the browser.

This was done in a few hours just for fun. Has some basic functions like importing and exporting, autoadding splits, tracking personal bests, gold splits, undo last split, pause...

Styling can be done live in devtools and options can be changed in the menu. Has global and local hotkeys for reset, pause, stop and split ([CTRL]+F9...F12 by default). Stopping while stopped updates splits and best segments. Stopping while reset adds some splits for editing. Resetting while reset clears everything! You can edit splits, times and game title by clicking.

While this is meant for nw.js and should work just fine on any platform, it also somewhat works in chrome, firefox, android or potatoes. Nw.js is the way to go with global hotkeys, menus, borderless windows, transparency...

##### You can test the basic functions in the [live preview](https://cdn.rawgit.com/Dregu/nwsplit/master/nwsplit.html).
