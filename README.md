# nwsplit
Cross platform speedrunning splitter/timer made for nw.js.

This was done in a few hours just for fun. Has some basic functions like importing and adding splits, autoadding splits, tracking personal bests, undo last split, pause...

Styling can be done live in devtools and options are changed in script console. Has global and local hotkeys for reset, pause, stop and split ([CTRL]+F9...F12 by default).

The html kinda works in chrome but in nw.js it's BEAUTIFUL and should work on windows/linux/mac just fine.

The JS looks like shit. You should see the dev console for more info.
